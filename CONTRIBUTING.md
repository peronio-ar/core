# Contribution Guidelines

We're very excited to have you contribute to the Peronio effort!

Please, take a minute to read the guidelines below so that your contribution can have the greatest impact.

-   Please follow the coding conventions you see applied to the already existing code. This includes running the necessary linters and observing the necessary naming conventions. Take into account that the project contains several different source languages, each will expect a different coding standard to be followed.
-   Try to make each of your commits stand on its own. As a general rule, one should be able to check-out an arbitrary commit and have the application not blow up on one's face.
-   Please do _not_ squash your commits upon creating a PR. The journey to a solution is as enlightening (if not more so) than the solution arrived at.
-   Please be patient, it can take us a couple of days to get to review your PR, but we _are_ looking at them.

Finally, take into account that PRs are not the only way you can contribute: spread the word, squash typos, write community documentation, whatever you can do helps tremendously!

Happy hacking!
